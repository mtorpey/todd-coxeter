active - Number of active cosets, doubly linked list
       forwd - Forward references
       backwd - Backward references
       lust - Reference to end of list
       d - Current coset
       Last coset linked to free list

free - Free cosets, simple linked list
     forwd - Forward references
     next - Reference to start of free list (0 if empty)

table - Images of cosets under generators
      table[i][c] - c^i - Image of coset c under gen i

inver - Pre-images of cosets under generators
      occur[i][c] - c^(i^-1) - Set of cosets which map to c under i
      Empty set = 0
      Used for replacing one coset with another everywhere
      inver contains just ONE coset, occur contains some more
